# mmo-tracker

Tired of keeping track of farming in one MMO while raiding with the bois on another, or wanting to look up items without bookmarking multiple third-party pages?

The goal of this project is to do just that. Demonstrating with Old School RuneScape and Final Fantasy XIV, the MMO Tracker will keep track of customizable local timers while also enabling search capabilities from within the application without leaving the site. Features planned:

Old School RuneScape (OSRS):
  - OSRS Wiki item look-ups
  - Hi Score table access
  - Quest Guide Access

Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV):
  - Item look-ups
  - Character Search by name and/or Lodestone ID with multiple fields for specificity
  - Tracking of player online status to include level, class, and world
  
Local:
  - Saved, programmable long-term timers with future sight on when you need to return to your activity
  - Clean, properly developed UX (because I am w e a k at bootstrap and CSS)

Stretch Goals:
  - Google Calendar integration to enable mobile device alerts
  - (FFXIV) Free Company member search and query capabilities
  - (OSRS) Clan Member status/player search
  
 The goal is to have a one-stop shop for supported MMORPGs with viable APIs.
